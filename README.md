# Python Test Switcher

A VS Code extension that allows you to quickly switch between Python implementation files and their corresponding test files. This extension makes it easy to navigate between your Python code and its tests, improving your development workflow.

## Features

- üîÑ Quick switching between implementation and test files
- üéØ Specific test file pattern matching:
  - From implementation to test: `foo/bar/my_module.py` ‚Üí `tests/unit/foo/bar/test_my_module.py` or `tests/integration/foo/bar/test_my_module.py`
  - From test to implementation
- üÜï Automatic creation of test files when they don't exist yet:
  - Prompts to create missing test files
  - Choose between unit or integration test location
  - Creates directory structure if needed
- ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard shortcuts for instant switching
- üéÆ Command palette integration
